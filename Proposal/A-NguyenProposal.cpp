use based on the information about the variables that user inputs. The user will
read the title and brief information about what the program will do. Then, the
user will be asked a sequence of questions regarding the nature of the variables
that they are testing. Based on the given input, the program will calculate and
state the best available statistical measure that the user should run. The user
should see a suggestion in the form of, "You should use (type of statistical
measure)!" The program would use switches to determine choice. */
